# Forbidden Lands Dice Roller

## Not yet functional

This app is descended from the Mutant: Year Zero app, which is live here: https://jkottler.github.io/myz-roller/

This simple app is designed to allow you to play the _Forbidden Lands_ tabletop RPG without physical access to their customized dice.

Operation should be self-explanatory: Set the number of base (yellow), skill (green), and gear (black) dice to be rolled with the on-screen controls. Press the **Roll** button to roll them. Click the **Push** button to push a roll.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See documentation there for details.
