# Mutant Year Zero Dice Roller

This simple app is designed to allow you to play the _Mutant: Year Zero_ line of tabletop RPGs from [Modiphius](https://www.modiphius.com/mutant.html) without physical access to their customized dice.

Operation should be self-explanatory: Set the number of base, skill, and gear dice to be rolled with the on-screen controls. Press the **Roll** button to roll them. Click the **Push** button to push a roll.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See documentation there for details.
